<p>The media server is set up to be mostly automated, although a number of factors can prevent it from being fully
    automatic. I do my best to improve this, with the end goal being a server that requires no intervention on my part
    and minimal maintenance.</p>

<ul>
    <li>This is just a hobby, not my full time job. The server is available for you to use whenever it&#39;s working.
        Please let me know if anything isn&#39;t working, as I always want to improve it, but respectfully your movie
        not working is not my top priority</li>
    <li>I want this to be a useful resource for you, but please be respectful. I pay for this out of my own pocket
        (notably storage) so please be mindful</li>
    <li>Don&#39;t share access to this server with other people. I&#39;m open to adding more users, but please keep me
        in the loop<h1 id="setup-guide">Setup Guide</h1>
        The media server has a lot of different software and services running, so this section will provide you with
        some info on notable services and help you set them up. I may get a bit technical at times, but I do this so
        that you have a better understanding of how everything works.<h2 id="tailscale">Tailscale</h2>
    </li>
    <li>Tailscale is used to connect whatever device you are watching media on to the media server. The media server is
        connected, but not exposed to the internet, meaning the only way to access it is via Tailscale</li>
    <li>Tailscale essentially makes a virtual network that connects devices. This means that even if we are across the
        world, our devices can see and talk to each other privately (no one else can see our computers talking)<h3
            id="setup">Setup</h3>
    </li>
    <li>download Tailscale on your device using <a
            href="https://tailscale.com/download">https://tailscale.com/download</a></li>
    <li>after installing, create an account and then contact me so I can grant you access. When you do this, remind me
        to create you an account on Jellyfin as well, and I will respond with your username and password.<h2
            id="jellyfin">Jellyfin</h2>
    </li>
    <li>Jellyfin is a media streaming and management software that for all intents and purposes replaces Netflix. It
        gives the media server a familiar feel, making it easy to organize and stream movies/shows<h3 id="setup">Setup

    </li>
    <li>Download Jellyfin Client (Media Player) using the links below<ol>
            <li>Windows: <a
                    href="https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-media-player/releases">https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-media-player/releases</a>
                (you want &quot;JellyfinMediaPlayer-1.9.1-windows-x64.exe&quot;)</li>
            <li>iOS: <a
                    href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/swiftfin/id1604098728">https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/swiftfin/id1604098728</a>
            </li>
            <li>MacOS: <a
                    href="https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-media-player/releases">https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-media-player/releases</a>
                (I have not tested this software on MacOS, but I believe it should work out of the box. You want
                &quot;JellyfinMediaPlayer-1.9.1-macos-notarized.dmg&quot;)</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Launch your Jellyfin Client (please ensure that Tailscale is both running and connected)</li>
    <li>In Tailscale (<a
            href="https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines">https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines</a>) find
        &quot;andyjellyfinserver&quot; and copy the address (should be similar format to &quot;100.xxx.xx.xx&quot; (the
        x&#39;s will be numbers))</li>
    <li>Enter the Tailscale address followed by :8096 in the host field (e.g. 100.xxx.xx.xx:8096) and click
        &quot;Connect&quot;<ol>
            <li>![[Pasted image 20240214103855.png]]</li>
            <li>:8096 is the port that Jellyfin runs on, meaning &quot;100.126.93.52&quot; is the address of the entire
                media server, and :8096 is the specific port that Jellyfin runs through</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>You should now be on the sign in screen. Enter the Jellyfin username and password I gave you earlier and click
        &quot;Sign In&quot;<ol>
            <li>![[Pasted image 20240214104130.png]]</li>
            <li>If you don&#39;t have an account, reach out to me and I can make you on (it takes like 30 seconds)</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>You should now be connected! Click on a movie or show, and test it out.<ol>
            <li>Your screen should look something like this: ![[Pasted image 20240214104522.png]]<h3 id="notes">Notes

        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Using the Jellyfin Client on your device helps to reduce the workload on the media server. Simply put, the
        client allows the server to send the media file directly/raw, as opposed to changing (transcoding) the file to a
        different format before sending it. Transcoding put strain on the media server, and using the client allows more
        people to use the server concurrently</li>
</ul>
