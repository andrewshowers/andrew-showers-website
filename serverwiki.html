  <p>The media server is set up to be mostly automated, although a number
    of factors can prevent it from being fully automatic. I do my best to
    improve this, with the end goal being a server that requires no
    intervention on my part and minimal maintenance.</p>
  <h1 id="expectations">Expectations</h1>
  <hr>
  <ul>
    <li>This is just a hobby, not my full time job. The server is
      available for you to use whenever it’s working. Please let me know if
      anything isn’t working, as I always want to improve it, but respectfully
      your movie not working is not my top priority</li>
    <li>I want this to be a useful resource for you, but please be
      respectful. I pay for this out of my own pocket (notably storage) so
      please be mindful</li>
    <li>Don’t share access to this server with other people. I’m open to adding more users, but please keep me in
      the loop</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The media server has a lot of different software and services
    running, so this section will provide you with some info on notable
    services and help you set them up. I may get a bit technical at times,
    but I do this so that you have a better understanding of how everything
    works.</p>

  <h2 id="tailscale">Tailscale</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Tailscale is used to connect whatever device you are watching
      media on to the media server. The media server is connected, but not
      exposed to the internet, meaning the only way to access it is via
      Tailscale</li>
    <li>Tailscale essentially makes a virtual network that connects
      devices. This means that even if we are across the world, our devices
      can see and talk to each other privately (no one else can see our
      computers talking)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="setup">Setup</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>download Tailscale on your device using https://tailscale.com/download</li>
    <li>after installing, go to https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines and create an account, then contact me so I can
      grant you access. When you do this, remind me to create you an account
      on Jellyfin as well, and I will respond with your username and password.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="jellyfin">Jellyfin</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Jellyfin is a media streaming and management software that for all
      intents and purposes replaces Netflix. It gives the media server a
      familiar feel, making it easy to organize and stream movies/shows</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="setup-1">Setup</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Download Jellyfin Client (Media Player) using the links below
      <ol>
        <li>Windows: https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-media-player/releases (you want
          “JellyfinMediaPlayer-1.9.1-windows-x64.exe”)</li>
        <li>iOS: https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/swiftfin/id1604098728</li>
        <li>MacOS:
          https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-media-player/releases (I have not
          tested this software on MacOS, but I believe it should work out of the
          box. You want “JellyfinMediaPlayer-1.9.1-macos-notarized.dmg”)</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Launch your Jellyfin Client (please ensure that Tailscale is both running and connected)</li>
    <li>In Tailscale (https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines) find
      “andyjellyfinserver” and copy the address (should be similar format to
      “100.xxx.xx.xx” (the x’s will be numbers))</li>
    <li>Enter the Tailscale address followed by :8096 in the host field (e.g. 100.xxx.xx.xx:8096) and click
      “Connect”
      <ol>
        <li>![[Pasted image 20240214103855.png]]</li>
        <li>:8096 is the port that Jellyfin runs on, meaning
          “100.126.93.52” is the address of the entire media server, and :8096 is
          the specific port that Jellyfin runs through</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>You should now be on the sign in screen. Enter the Jellyfin username and password I gave you earlier and
      click “Sign In”
      <ol>
        <li>![[Pasted image 20240214104130.png]]</li>
        <li>If you don’t have an account, reach out to me and I can make you on (it takes like 30 seconds)</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>You should now be connected! Click on a movie or show, and test it out.
      <ol>
        <li>Your screen should look something like this: ![[Pasted image 20240214104522.png]]</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Using the Jellyfin Client on your device helps to reduce the
      workload on the media server. Simply put, the client allows the server
      to send the media file directly/raw, as opposed to changing
      (transcoding) the file to a different format before sending it.
      Transcoding put strain on the media server, and using the client allows
      more people to use the server concurrently</li>
  </ul>
