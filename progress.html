                Today I started this progress page. Currently I am working on this website so that I can track my cs and cyber progress and look back on it.

            Today I tried to duel boot linux on my laptop. It turns out I bought some bad flash drives and they are unable to be written to no matter what I do. I did a little bit of reading about kali, and I am excited to test it out.

            Yesterday I finished installing ubuntu on my laptop. I wanted to play around with an easy to use version of linux before I start using Kali. I am typing this post from linux, and after a lot of trial and error I am starting to get the hang of it. It is odd istalling applications through terminal as opposed to just opening a .exe file and being done.
